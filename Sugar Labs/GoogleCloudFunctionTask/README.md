# Sugar Labs Cloud Function

Included is the source code for the Cloud Function. In index.js, we see that due to a HTML trigger, "Hello World" is returned, and will be presented on the screen. The Cloud Function continuously runs this helloWorld Function.

The package.json file includes the initialization for the cloud function and initializes the Firebase function tools.
